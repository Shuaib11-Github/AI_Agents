        "\n",
        "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a groundbreaking AI technique that boosts the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating real-time document retrieval during text generation. Traditional RAG methods, such as Naive RAG, can falter when faced with complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Enter **Agentic RAG**, which combines RAG's retrieval capabilities with autonomous decision-making agents, offering unparalleled performance in handling intricate queries.\n",
